# An introduction to the pursuit of Net Zero:
By Ryan Chan - Hong Kong

## Introduction

The pursuit of net zero has become a central principle of climate policy and strategy. According to the United Nations, net-zero simply means cutting anthropogenic carbon emissions to a small amount of residual emissions that can be absorbed and durably stored by nature and other carbon dioxide removal measures, leaving zero in the atmosphere (United Nations, 2024). The term net-zero is now increasingly relevant due to its relation with the greenhouse effect and climate change. To understand the pursuit of Net Zero, it is important to first gain a fundamental understanding of the greenhouse effect and its connection to climate change. This article, being the first of a series of articles surrounding sustainability, renewable energy and environmental policy under the umbrella of climate change aims to introduce fundamental concepts surrounding the greenhouse effect, climate change and the importance of net-zero. Hence, providing readers with a basis of understanding that will aid in their readings of future related articles.

## What is the greenhouse effect and how is it relevant to climate change?

‘Greenhouse gases’ are crucial to keeping our planet at a suitable temperature for life. Without the natural greenhouse effect, the heat emitted by the Earth would simply pass outwards from the Earth’s surface into space and the Earth would have an average temperature of about -20°C (British Geological Survey, 2023). The name ‘greenhouse gasses’ stems from its role in regulating Earth’s temperatures. Greenhouse gases act similarly to the glass in a greenhouse: they absorb the sun’s heat that radiates from the Earth’s surface, trap it in the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space (European Parliament, 2023).

## What do humans have to do with climate change?

The CO2 released from the burning of fossil fuels is accumulating as an insulating blanket around the Earth, trapping more of the Sun’s heat in our atmosphere. Actions carried out by humans are called anthropogenic actions and human activities have a tremendous impact on the carbon cycle. Burning fossil fuels, changing land use, and using limestone to make concrete all transfer significant quantities of carbon into the atmosphere (Noaa.gov, 2025). This is important because the anthropogenic release of CO2 is the main and most significant contributor to the current enhanced greenhouse effect, drastically disrupting the natural carbon cycle’s equilibrium that has been established and maintaining our planet’s temperatures for billions of years.

The large amounts of anthropogenic release of C02 that is occurring in the modern day disrupt the carbon cycle as each year, human activities release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than natural processes can remove, causing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to increase. Specifically, fossil fuels like coal and oil contain the carbon from millions of years of photosynthesis—the process by which plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—and humans are returning that carbon to the atmosphere at a rapid rate of just a few hundred years. Since the middle of the 20th century, annual emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels have increased every decade, from close to 11 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year in the 1960s to an estimated 37.4 billion tons in 2024 according to the Global Carbon Budget 2024. This has led to a new record high of global average carbon dioxide in 2024: 422.7 parts per million ("ppm" for short) (NOAA Climate.gov, 2025).

## What are the implications of anthropogenic carbon emissions and the disruption of the delicate carbon cycle?

Record level highs of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere have exacerbated climate change, and the consequences of decades of ignorance of environmental sustainability amongst policy-makers and the general public are driving the Earth towards potentially irreversible tipping points, with climate change posing many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth (United Nations, 2024). With the amount of carbon dioxide already greater than at any time in the last 3.6 million years, the ocean is now absorbing much of the carbon dioxide that is released from burning fossil fuels. This extra carbon dioxide is lowering the ocean’s pH through a process called ocean acidification.

Ocean acidification interferes with the ability of marine organisms (including corals, Dungeness crabs, and snails) to build their shells and skeletons. Moreover, examples of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change include recent “once in a hundred years” storms that have occurred more frequently in the 21st century (e.g. Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and Hurricane Maria), as higher temperatures cause more water vapor to be evaporated into the atmosphere which acts as fuel for more powerful storms. This heat and high ocean surface temperature also cause increased wind speed, which increases the mortality and damage risk for hurricanes and other storms (Nyu.edu, 2019).

## What role can sustainability, renewable energy and policy making play in the mitigation of anthropogenic caused climate change?

Sustainability, renewable energy, and effective policy making offer practical pathways to curbing the enhanced greenhouse effect. Sustainability practices—such as reforestation, sustainable agriculture, and circular economies—enhance natural carbon sinks while minimizing waste and resource depletion. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal, displace fossil fuels, directly slashing CO₂ emissions; for instance, Ember Energy reports that growth in solar and wind pushed the world past 30% renewable electricity for the first time in 2023 (EMBER, 2024), with projections for further growth under supportive policies (IEA, 2024).

Effective policymaking accelerates this transition through mechanisms like carbon pricing, subsidies for clean technologies, international agreements such as the Paris Accord, and national net-zero targets—over 140 countries have now committed to net-zero by mid-century (United Nations, 2024). By integrating these elements, societies can reduce residual emissions to levels absorbable by nature and technology, averting the worst climate impacts and paving the way for a resilient, low-carbon future. This ideal foundational shift not only mitigates risks associated with climate change but also fosters economic innovation and equity, which will be further explored in subsequent articles.
